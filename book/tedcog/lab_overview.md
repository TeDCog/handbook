# 1. Overview of the TeDCog Lab

## Our Mission

The TeDCog group is an interdisciplinary group hosted mainly in the School of Psychological Science at the University of Bristol that examines the pressure points between human cognition and online technologies, and the consequences for democracy that arise from those pressure points.

## The core meetings
The TeDCog group is organized around weekly meetings. All members are strongly encouraged to attend because the meetings allow for discussion of ideas and keep everyone informed about current developments. The weekly meetings also regularly feature external speakers from all around the world.
    
* The weekly meeting is being held on Wednesday 1-2pm UK time. This is a hybrid seminar style meeting (you can attend virtually or in-person).
* The schedule for the current academic year can be found [here](https://airtable.com/appxb9Isc27Mykp3I/shrAlPm4KJpt8X7fE/tblRPm7DDhYD2Xj6j).
 

**Please [email a request to join the mailing list](mailto:TeDCog@bristol.ac.uk) to get updates on the meeting schedule, agenda, and Zoom/meeting room links. You cannot be a member of the group without being on the mailing list.**

We designed and will run the group meetings by considering the [10 rules published here](https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008953).
